Flask Web App for LinkedIn Profile Scraping and Summarization
This project is a Flask web application that takes a person's name as input, searches for their LinkedIn profile using the Tavily API, and scrapes relevant information using Proxycurl. The application then summarizes the scraped data using a language model (LLM) and displays the summarized information along with the person's profile picture.
